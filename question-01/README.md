Abstract

There is a need to identify where student success disparities are occurring in engineering,
investigate why the differences are present, and propose institutional and pedagogical changes to
address them. This work seeks to understand how the gap in student success amongst students in
engineering is correlated to student identity and academic level. Built upon an anti-deficit
framework, this study works to reframe the narrative around the achievement gap acknowledging
the impact that climate and support have on students of color and women in engineering.
The authors hypothesize that there is a difference in academic performance by a student’s gender
and race and that this gap is not reliant solely upon academic preparedness. The work
investigates 10 years of academic records for engineering students at a midwestern,
predominantly White, Jesuit institution. The data shows that White women received higher
grades than every other group of students. On the contrary, men of color, including Black,
Latinx, and Asian students, earn grades below the population mean. To investigate how the
curriculum structure affects student success, an analysis of performance by course level (1000,
2000, etc.) is detailed. This analysis finds that course level is a significant factor in student
success and the gap amongst demographic groups. At the 1000 level in engineering courses,
White men, Asian women, and Black men perform at the population mean; White women
perform above the mean; and Latinx men and women perform below the mean. However, at the
2000 level in engineering courses, all men of color earn grades below the population mean, with
Black men dropping to 0.5 GPA points below the population mean on a 4.0 scale. Additional
exploration of students’ academic preparedness, including standardized test scores, is conducted
to identify the correlation of prior metrics on the gap in performance. Future work is focused on
understanding what factors are influencing these disparities and how classroom and institutional
design can mitigate the effects.
